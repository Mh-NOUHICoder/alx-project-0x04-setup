**Duration:** _Sep 29 – Oct 6, 2025_  
**Weight:** _1_  
**QA Review:** _Pending (Manual)_  
**Auto Review:** _0.0 / 9 mandatory_

---

## 📘 Overview

**StateCraft** explores state management in React by building a simple **Counter App**.  
It demonstrates progressive techniques — from `useState` to **Context API** and **Redux Toolkit** — showing how to manage shared and global state effectively in modern React applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand React state with `useState`  
- Implement global state using Context API  
- Master complex state handling with Redux Toolkit  
- Compare different state management strategies  
- Apply the “single source of truth” concept  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React** (v18+)  
- **Next.js**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Redux Toolkit & React-Redux**  
- **Node.js** (v14+)  
- **VS Code** + **Modern Browser**

## 🧱 Project Structure
```bash
pages/ → Page components (e.g., counter-app.tsx)
components/ → Reusable UI parts
layouts/ → Layout & shared components
context/ → Context API (CountContext.tsx)
store/ → Redux store configuration
```


---

## 🧩 Versions

- **0x04 – useState:** Local component state  
- **0x05 – Context API:** Shared global state with providers  
- **0x06 – Redux:** Scalable, centralized state with slices  

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused  
- Use TypeScript for type safety  
- Separate UI and state logic  
- Treat state as immutable  
- Use Redux slices and typed hooks  

---

## 📈 Expected Outcome

By completing this project, you’ll:

- Build a working counter app in 3 ways  
- Understand when to use each state method  
- Gain real-world experience managing React state  

---

## ⚠️ Notes

> Don’t just copy code — type it, test it, and experiment.  
> Hands-on learning builds lasting understanding.
